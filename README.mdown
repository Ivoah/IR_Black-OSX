# A black OS X Leopard Terminal theme that is actually readable

This Terminal theme was created by Todd Werth (http://blog.infinitered.com/). See his original blog post "here":http://blog.infinitered.com/entries/show/6.

This repo contains all the necessary files to get it working under Mac OS 10.6+; conveniently in one place.

## Installation 

1. Install the SIMBL plugin package for Snow Leopard by double clicking it or running the following

    sudo install -pkg SIMBL-0.9.7.pkg -target "/"

2. Copy the TerminalColours.bundle:
	
		* For all users
		
		mkdir -p /Library/Application\ Support/SIMBL/Plugins
		cp -r TerminalColours.bundle /Library/Application\ Support/SIMBL/Plugins

		* For just you
		
		mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/SIMBL/Plugins
		cp -r TerminalColours.bundle ~/Library/Application\ Support/SIMBL/Plugins
		
3. Double click the IR_Black.terminal file. Go to Terminal -> Preferences -> Setting and set IR_Black as the default theme

4. Thats it. Optionally you could add Todd's bash script which you can find "here":http://github.com/twerth/dotfiles. The ones in this repo have minor modifications to suit my taste.
